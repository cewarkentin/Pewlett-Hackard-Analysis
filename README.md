## Overview of Project

Pewlett Hackard is a large company looking to appropriately prepare for the upcoming retirement wave of its Baby Boomer employees. 

1. PH would like to offer a retirement package to certain eligible employees.
2. PH would like to establish a mentorship program to train employees filling the expected vacant positions.

Provided with the following data:

we established a PH employee database and used SQL to make queries identifying th number of retiring employees by job title, as well as the employees eligible for the mentorship program.

Based on provided information, potentially retiring employees were identified based on birthdates between 1952-1955.

## Results

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
